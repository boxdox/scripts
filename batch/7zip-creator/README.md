# Installation

1. Download this repository or clone it onto your PC.
2. Put files to be compressed into the 'putfileshere' directory.
3. Run 'makearchive.bat'
4. Get your file!

Update: I have no idea why I made a script for the work the CLI app was already doing.
Guess it felt awesome at that moment. So much for learning to code.
