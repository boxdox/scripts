# Little Background Info
Whenever I downloaded a torrent, my uTorrent would automatically move those downloads to other drive. Most of the time it worked fine. But I had the option called "Append !UT to incomplete donwloads", so sometimes, if uTorrent got closed unexpectedly, it used to put .!ut extension to all completed downloads too! (Weird).


So, I decided to write a script that would simplify the renaming process, instead to spending hours to manually remove extensions.

### NOTE: This script not only works for .!UT extensions, but for all types of extensions!

# ~~Installation~~ Instructions (Duh)
1. Download this script
2. Place this script in the directory where you need to batch remove the extensions.
3. Run the script, it will ask you the extension to remove. Enter the extension without the period, ie (if extension is `file.exe.!ut`, type in `!ut`)
4. Magic! (Seriously?!)

Update: Instructions were difficult to understand, so I tried to re-write them. I take no responsibility if my English is still bad.
