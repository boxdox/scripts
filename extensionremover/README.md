# Little Background Info
Whenever I downloaded a torrent, my uTorrent would automatically move those downloads to other drive. Most of the time it worked fine. But I had the option called "Append !UT to incomplete donwloads", so sometimes, if uTorrent got closed unexpectedly, it used to put .!ut extension to all completed downloads too! (Weird).


So, I decided to write a script that would simplify the renaming process, instead to spending hours to manually remove extensions.

### NOTE: This script not only works for .!UT extensions, but for all types of extensions!

# Installation Instructions (Duh)
1. Download this script
2. Place in in the directory that contains the files whose extension is to be changed
3. Run the file, type in the extension (Everything after the last .) :P
4. Magic!
