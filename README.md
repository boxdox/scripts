# scripts

I used to maintain multiple repositories for different type of simple scripts that came in handy during everyday tasks on PC.

So, I decided to aggregate all of the repos into one single, giant repo containing all of my scripts in one place. So here's that.

> Note: Some scripts are taken from the internet, I have given proper credits to the author.

One more point: Some of the scripts might be poorly coded and since they are archived for my coding history, I neither would be updating them nor take a joke of my preliminary coding skills. xD. 

### Disclaimer
I take no responsibility if these scripts in any way damage files in your PC. Do your research and understand the pathetic code I might have written and then, only then, run the code. You have been warned.

### Licence
These scripts are under GNU GPL licence. Knock yourselves out.
